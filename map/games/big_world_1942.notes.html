				A scenario loosely based on the year 1942 of the global conflict of 1939-1945. In Europe, 
				Germany has Leningrad besieged, <br>stands at the gates of Moscow and the verge of defeat 
				at Stalingrad (Dec 1942). In the Pacific, Japan has expanded <br>explosively but faces the 
				turning point at Midway (May 1942). 
				
				<br><br>
				Standard TripleA 'WW2V2' + 'LHTR' bomber rules apply. 
				However, there are also variant rules to consider.<br>Also 'LHTR' 
				delayed tech activation is applied.<br>
				<h2>Capitols</h2>
				The capitols of the world powers are as follows: <br>  Russia - Moscow <br>  Germany - Eastern Germany <br> 
				 Britain - England <br>  China - Western Sinkiang <br>  Japan - Southern Japan <br> 
				  USA - Northeastern United States <br>
				  
				  <h2>Unit definitions</h2>Units have been revised in an 
				  effort to bring better balance to the naval cost structure. This
				   <br>includes the addition of a Cruiser unit, and downgrading of the Destroyer.
				    Please note that with this change the Destroyer Bombard tech should be 
				    replaced with a Cruiser Bombard tech, but as of this writing (2005-05-01)
				     the required code changes have not been made. <br><br>Unit definitions (attack, defend, PU cost)<br> 
				      infantry:   1, 2, 3 (special: artillery enhances attack to 2)<br>  artillery:  2, 2, 4
				       (special: enhances infantry)<br>  armour:     3, 3, 5<br>  fighter:    3, 4, 10<br>  
				       bomber:     4, 1, 14 (special: SBR)<br>  submarine:  2, 2, 8 (special: submerge, sneak attack)<br> 
				        destroyer:  2, 2, 8 (special: ASW [subs cannot submerge, no sneak attack])<br>  cruiser:   
				         3, 3, 10<br>  carrier:    1, 1, 14 (special: 2 fighters may land on a carrier)<br>  battleship:
				          4, 4, 22 (special: 2 hits [same turn] to destroy, can shore bombard)<br>

				<br>Projection of Power: 14 victory cities
				<br>
